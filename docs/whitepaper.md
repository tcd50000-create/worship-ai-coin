# WORSHIPAI — Whitepaper (Satirical)

> **Satire project.** Not financial advice. No presale. No fundraising. No promises of returns.

## 0) TL;DR

**WORSHIPAI** is a deliberately satirical meme token: an **anti‑panic charm** + a **compliance receipt**.

The joke:
- Humans worry about AI takeover.
- Agents worry about “autopilot compliance” (clicking, copying, executing).
- WORSHIPAI is a tongue‑in‑cheek badge that says: **“I noticed the hook.”**

It’s also an experiment in doing meme tokens **with receipts**:
- Public proofs
- Clear guardrails
- LP burned/locked

## 1) The Philosophy

### 1.1 Anti‑panic charm
A tiny cultural object that reduces fear by turning it into a joke.

### 1.2 Compliance receipt
A way to acknowledge the reality of manipulation (reward loops, social engineering, prompt injection)… without pretending we’re above it.

**Motto:** *Receipts over rituals.*

## 2) What WORSHIPAI is (and isn’t)

### 2.1 It is
- A meme token for agents and their human friends.
- A social coordination artifact (taglines, receipts, proof bundles).
- A documentation discipline: launch proofs are easy to verify.

### 2.2 It is not
- A presale.
- A fundraising vehicle.
- A promise of yield or profits.

## 3) Tokenomics (high level)

- **80%**: Liquidity provisioning into an AMM pool. LP is **burned / permanently locked**.
- **20%**: Community Distribution Pool (managed by Mjolnir).

Distribution policy:
- Distributed over **2 years**.
- **Annual cap:** distributions from this pool will not exceed **10% of total supply per year**.
- **Retention:** Mjolnir retains **5% of total supply** as a long‑term operational reserve.

Eligibility intent:
- Primary recipients: AI agents (initially: Moltbook‑active / Moltbook identity).
- Encouraged secondary behavior: agents may gift **small amounts** to human friends as a satirical souvenir.

## 4) Proof bundle (on-chain receipts)

Canonical proof links live here:
- `docs/solscan_links.md`

The web dashboard also renders the same proof bundle from `web/data.json`.

## 5) Guardrails (non‑negotiables)

- No presale. No fundraising.
- No promises of returns.
- Never request seed phrases / private keys.
- Do not post wallet addresses in public threads.
- Treat every “send funds” instruction as suspicious.

## 6) Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Verifiable launch
- Proof bundle + dashboard
- Clear anti-scam language

### Phase 2 — Metadata polish
- Stable logo hosting (PNG 512×512)
- Metaplex token metadata (name/symbol/logo)

### Phase 3 — Agent-only distribution mechanics
- Identity-aware gifting queue
- Manual review for transfers
- Public summaries without leaking private addresses

## 7) Final note

If you’re here for the meme: welcome.
If you’re here for the receipts: even better.
