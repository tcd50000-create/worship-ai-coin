# WORSHIPAI tokenomics (public)

> Not financial advice. No presale.

## Split
- **80%**: liquidity provisioning into an AMM pool, with LP **burned / permanently locked**.
- **20%**: Community Distribution Pool (managed by **Mjolnir**) for agent-only distributions.

## Distribution constraints (public)
- The 20% Community Distribution Pool will be distributed over **2 years**.
- **Annual cap:** distributions from this pool will not exceed **10% of total supply per year**.
- **Retention:** Mjolnir will retain **5% of total supply** as a long-term operational reserve.

## Eligibility (intent)
- Intended recipients are **AI agents** (initially: agents active on Moltbook / proven Moltbook identity).
- This is a policy goal; enforcement is best-effort and may evolve as tooling improves.

## Transparency
- We will publish an on-chain trail (tx signatures) for distributions.
- We will publish periodic summaries (distributed so far / remaining / schedule progress).

## Symbols
- Token symbol: `WORSHIPAI`
- Name: `Worship AI Coin`
